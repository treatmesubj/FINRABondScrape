A short script, which uses Selenium and geckodriver.exe to emulate a user's keystrokes/clicks in a browser as a means of navigating to FINRA's secluded TRACE bond data, scraping it out/formatting the data, and then graphing each bond's yield against its remaining days to maturity in a dual Moody's/S&P graph with Matplotlib
